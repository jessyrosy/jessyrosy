Working with an API, enablesa distribution layer for information and services to new audiences may be built, which can then be customized to produce unique user experiences. An API also enables every individual, not just a chosen few, to have access to all of the data produced at the government level.

Hiring API developers enables you to accomplish all of this. It translates to maximum accessibility for your clients, who will have quick access to all the information they require. There are currently 4.43 million APIs available, an 85 percent increase from five years ago, according to a recent study from Programmable Web.

1. Log in to the API Toolkit Dashboard. 
2. Create a project. To create a project, you only need to provide a title and a brief description of the project. Adding members to your dashboard is another option available. 
3. Get your API key. Don't forget to copy it to the clipboard or, even better, write it down. If you don't, you can lose access to that key in the future. Yes, I committed that error when accessing the API for the first time. 
4. The process of integrating is very simple; all you have to do is copy the code from the Golang docs into your own code, then paste your copied API key where it says API Key in angular brackets, and there you have it! You can go ahead and check your end points
